## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### Continued development

The area that i want to focus on in future projects is learning bootstrap frameworks and javascript. Also to learn and perfect dynamic HTML/CSS using concepts like flexboxes etc. 

### Useful resources

- https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox.asp - This helped me in learning flexboxes. I really liked this pattern and explaination and will use it going forward.
